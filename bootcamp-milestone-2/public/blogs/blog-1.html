                    <p>
                        I have a 9 AM data structures class and it is way too
                        early. I thought college was supposed to be about having
                        fun, but I can either sleep late like I like or actually
                        get some sleep
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I usually wake up at 7:45 and leave by 8:50 because it's
                        about a 20 minute walk from PCV to class. Last Monday I
                        ended up waking up at 8:30 and having to hurry up
                        through my routine and walk really fast to make it to
                        class. I probably should sleep earlier but I love
                        working at night so what am I supposed to do.
